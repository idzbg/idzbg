I created this because it's cool.

## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

**idzbg/idzbg** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ... things I'm working on.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ... how to learn effectively.
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on ... our collaborations.
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with ... my problems.
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about ... questions I may or may not answer.
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: ... by sending magic packets.
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: ... pass/fail
- âš¡ Fun fact: ... there can be an infinite number of ' is true' after 'true' and it will still hold.
