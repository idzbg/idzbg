I created this because it's cool.

## Hi there 👋

**idezbug/idezbug** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on ... things I'm working on.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... how to learn effectively.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on ... our collaborations.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with ... my problems.
- 💬 Ask me about ... questions I may or may not answer.
- 📫 How to reach me: ... by sending magic packets.
- 😄 Pronouns: ... pass/fail
- ⚡ Fun fact: ... there can be an infinite number of ' is true' after 'true' and it will still hold.
